# Weather-Dashboard

This application allows a user to retrive data from another application's API, in this case, OpenWeather API, to retrieve weather data for cities.

As a travel, the user is able to utilize the API to get the weather for multiple cities.

Current weather conditions will display the current date, an icon representing the weather, the temperature in fahrenheit, the humidity and the windspeed.

Weather conditions will also include a UV Index, which will show up red if it is above a certain number, indiciating that those with sensitivities to ulrtraviolet rays should avoid being outside without UV protection. The green bar will show that the UV index is low.

Below current weather conditions, a 5 Day Forecast will also be displayed for the city. The display will include the date, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
